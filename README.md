# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, I also used the JavaScript date library, moment, to format timestamps. MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
